# deep-learning-image-classifier
Training an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.

I submitted this project as part of the Udacity's Introduction Into Machine Learning Nanodegree program. The goal is to build and train an image classifier. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. The dataset used from Oxford of 102 flower categories.

The project is broken down into:
- loading the image dataset and creating a pipeline
- building and training an image classifier
- using the trained model to make a prediction on some flower images
